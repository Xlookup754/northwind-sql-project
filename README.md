# Northwind SQL Project

## Overview
This project is based on the Northwind Traders dataset, which simulates a small international business that sells food and beverage products. The company processes customer orders, manages employees, ships products through third-party carriers, and occasionally offers discounts. I used SQL to analyze their operations and answer questions that would matter to a real business trying to grow and stay competitive.

## Business Questions Answered
Who are the top 5 customers by revenue?
Which product categories perform best over time?
Which employees generate the most revenue per customer?
What products are frequently reordered?
Which countries bring in the most revenue?
Are discounts hurting profitability?
How efficient are our shippers?
Which customers show signs of churn?


## Tools Used
MySQL, Excel and Powerpoint 

## Key Insights
I started by identifying who the top customers were. The analysis showed that just five customers account for over 17 percent of total sales. That kind of concentration means the business relies heavily on a small group of clients, so keeping them happy is key.
Next, I looked into which products consistently perform well over time. I found that some products deliver reliable revenue month after month. These are the ones the company should double down on through better marketing and inventory planning.
On the employee side, I discovered that Nancy Davolio stands out for handling large, high-revenue orders. She brings in strong average order values and represents a model of high performance.
I also analyzed reorder behavior and found that some products  specifically ProductID 24 and 56 are frequently reordered by the same customers. This shows strong product loyalty, which is something the business can build on.
When I shifted focus to geography, I found that Germany and the United States bring in the most revenue. These countries represent the most valuable markets and might be worth prioritizing in future sales strategies.
I also checked how discounts were impacting the bottom line. It turns out that discounts are reducing overall revenue by a significant margin. This means the company needs to rethink when and how it applies discounts.
Shipping efficiency was another key area. I compared average delivery times across shippers and saw clear differences. Some carriers consistently deliver faster, which the company should factor in when choosing partners.
Finally, I looked at customer churn. Over 80 percent of at-risk customers haven’t ordered in more than 10 years. That’s a long time, and it points to a major gap in how the company manages long-term customer relationships.

## Recommendations
The company should start by creating a strong customer retention strategy focused on its top clients. These are high-value relationships that deserve regular follow-up and possibly loyalty rewards.
Next, it should focus its energy on the products and regions that drive the most consistent revenue. That means strengthening inventory and promotions around the best sellers and investing in marketing to countries that already perform well.
Discounts should be more targeted. Instead of applying them broadly, the company should use them strategically only when needed to close a sale or boost a low-performing product.
Shipping contracts should also be reviewed. Faster delivery times mean happier customers, so it makes sense to work more closely with the most efficient shippers.
And finally, the company should consider a re-engagement campaign for customers who haven’t ordered in years. Even if just a small percentage return, that’s still meaningful revenue that’s currently being left on the table.
